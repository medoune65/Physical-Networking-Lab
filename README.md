# Physical-Networking-Lab


# Overview 
In this lab I will be taking the concepts I learned from cisco packet tracer and applying it in the real world using physical cisco  equipment. The equipment I will be using in this lab are 2 cisco 2811 routers, 2 cisco 2960 catalyst switches, 2 end devices, one CAT 6 crossover ethernet cable, and 4 CAT 6 straight through ethernet cables. I will be recreating the network topology shown in the image below.

# Networking concepts Implemented in this Lab:
  -	VLAN’s 
  -	Trunking
  -	DHCP
  -	RIP Routing Protocol
  -	Access Control Lists (ACL’s)



# Tasks:
    1.	Configure VLAN Interfaces for VLAN’s 10 and 20 on switches 1 and 2, assign ports 2-4 of each switch to VLAN 10 and the ports 5-8 to VLAN 20 (The first port on each switch will not be assigned to any VLAN we will be connecting it to the router)
    2.	Configure trunk interfaces on interface F0/1 on each switch so it can carry traffic from any VLAN
    3.	Configure IP addresses on router interfaces
    4.	Configure virtual VLAN router interface ip addresses so that each VLAN has a gateway
    5.	Configure the routers as DHCP servers to hand out IP addresses to their end devices
    6.	Configure the end devices to receive a DHCP IP address
    7.	Configure RIP routing protocol between the routers
    8.	Configure a standard ACL to prevent the devices on the printers VLAN from getting out of the network
    9.	Test communication
