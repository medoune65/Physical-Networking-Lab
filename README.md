# Physical-Networking-Lab


# Overview 
In this lab I will be taking the concepts I learned from cisco packet tracer and applying it in the real world using physical cisco  equipment. The equipment I will be using in this lab are 2 cisco 2811 routers, 2 cisco 2960 catalyst switches, 2 end devices, one CAT 6 crossover ethernet cable, and 4 CAT 6 straight through ethernet cables. I will be recreating the network topology shown in the image below.
